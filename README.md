# California Housing Price Prediction using SGDRegressor

This project uses **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Regression** from `scikit-learn` to predict housing prices in California based on various features such as median income, average rooms, and location attributes.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

The goal is to train an SGD-based linear regression model on the **California Housing dataset** and visualize its performance over multiple iterations.

### Key Steps:
1. Load the California housing dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
3. Normalize the data using **StandardScaler**.
4. Train the model iteratively using `SGDRegressor` with partial fitting.
5. Track model performance using MSE and RÂ² score.
6. Visualize:
   - Actual vs Predicted values
   - MSE per iteration
